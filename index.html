      <h1>Hi, I'm Bill Li!</h1>

      <p>
        I'm a high school student in Grade 12, and I live and go to school in Mississauga, Ontario.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passions have always involved computer science and art. Because of this, my side projects over the years have spanned many different areas - I have experience in game development, songwriting/production, graphic design, web and software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested in what I do, you can always reach me at <a href="mailto:bill.l1564262@gmail.com">bill.l1564262@gmail.com.</a>
      </p>

      <h1>Projects: Game Dev</h1>
      <p>
        I gained most of my experience and interest in coding making games in Actionscript, later transitioning to AS3 (before Flash eventually died).
      </p>
      <p>
        A majority of them were left unfinished, as I often found myself losing inspiration to finish them. All except one, which was Super Spatial Samurai. It was a project I worked with a couple of my friends, who helped me with art and music.

        We entered it into the Scholastic Arts and Writing Awards 2016. It was a great experience making it, learning a lot of time and project management skills.

      <h1>Game Dev (p.2)</h1>
      <p>
        Recently, I've taken a more artsy role, doing the art and music for my friend Peter (Pecas) for his game <a href="https://pecas.itch.io/boomeraxe">Boomeraxe</a>, a speedrunning platformer. As of September 2018, it received 700~ views and 100+ downloads.

        We went to TOJam '18 making <a href="https://pecas.itch.io/duelmania">DuelMania </a>, a small turn-based rpg with rhythm game mechanics.

      <h2>DUOL</h2>
			<p>
        DUOL is an app that was started at YorkUHacks 2018, and is currently under development. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Using accelerometer data from the phone, our group of 5 created a new way to face off against your friends. Two people on the same network can engage in blade-to-blade combat, taking turns attacking and defending to outplay their opponent. Moves or gestures are done by physically swinging your phone, in the same way you would with an actual sword. Players can also put their reactions to the test with an "endless" game mode.
      </p>
      <p>
        DUOL was built in Android Studio (Java). Right now, our goal is to publish this to the Google Play Store for anyone to download and play for free.

      <h2>Bus Routing Application*</h2>
			<p>
        *placeholder name - This app is also under development.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the beginning part of the year, our school bus company couldn't find available busses for us. Very often it was late, and we usually were met with a new driver each day. The driver wasn't familiar with the route, and often times we took a suboptimal route. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Although traditional routing services can be generated automatically, bus stops are usually placed by hand, which can take up a lot of time and effort depending on the number of houses.
      </p>
			<p>
        Our Node.js server retrieves data from HERE's Geocoding and Routing APIs, and our client renders the map and route. It only uses plain HTML/CSS for testing purposes, but we will upgrade it to use Bootstrap. 
      </p>

        You can try it here:

			<h1>Hackathons + Contests</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://devpost.com/software/f-speaking" target="_blank">F Speaking: the F stands for Fix</a></h2>
      <p>
        My group's submission for Hack the 6ix 2018 was a web application that could help people practice their public speaking. Using Google's Speech to Text API, we compared someone's speech with their original text and suggest things they could improve on. We built the application with Node.js, using p5.js and CSS to draw objects on screen.
      </p>
			<h2><a href="https://devpost.com/software/data_dump" target="_blank">Insurance Informatics</a></h2>
			<p>
        At Hack The North 2018, my group made a program that could read insurance data and dynamically display demographic data using dc.js. These graphs can be interacted with and filtered to a user's selection.

      <p>
        Our group made this project at MasseyHacks 2017. With Processing, we built a simple kid's game to teach keyboard fundamentals and the importance of water conservation.

			<p>
        I built this small simulation game for a p5.js challenge hosted by Hack Club and Repl.it. Based off Electroplankton for the DS, shapes play notes and create music as they move down paths set by the user. It got 5th place in total number of votes.

      <h1>Projects: Music</h1>
      <p>
        I got my start playing violin for 8 years starting at 6 years old, completing RCM Grades 5 and 7. I had some exposure to stage performance at recitals, in front of the parents of the music school I went to. I never finished music theory, but I'm willing to return and complete it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I only started to seriously pick up singing when I was 15. Before that, singing was mainly a small hobby. This was around the time I started to rap and songwrite too. I spent a lot of my off time during bus rides and vacations thinking of lyrics and melodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently a vocalist in my school's rock band, Forest Fire. Check out one of my performances here.

      <h1>Music (p.2)</h1>
      <p>
        I started picking up production in 2017 in FL Studio making trap beats, using online samples and mixing/mastering tutorials on YouTube. I've recently branched out into some pop and lofi on the side. In the future, I want to be able to work with EDM.

      <h1>Goals + Aspirations</h1>
      <p>
        I want to gain enough experience to be able to work independently. Although I do well with work that is assigned to me, having the freedom to choose what I can do projectwise is much more enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p>
        My long term goal is being able to make a name for myself. I want to impact as many people's lives as possible doing the things I love doing best, whether it's through coding or music. One of my biggest motivators is seeing that I've made a positive contribution, and being able to make a living through that experience is something I dream about doing.
