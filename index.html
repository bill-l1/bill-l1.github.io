      <h1>Hi, I'm Bill Li!</h1>

      <p>
        I'm in my first year of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passions have always involved computer science and art. Because of this, my side projects over the years have spanned many different areas - I have experience in game development, songwriting/production, graphic design, web and software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested in what I do, you can always reach me at <a href="mailto:bill.l1564262@gmail.com">bill.l1564262@gmail.com.</a>
      </p>

      <h1>Projects: Game Dev</h1>
      <p>
        I gained most of my experience and interest in coding making games in Actionscript, later transitioning to AS3 (before Flash eventually died).
      </p>
      <p>
        A majority of them were left unfinished, as I often found myself losing inspiration to finish them. All except one, which was Super Spatial Samurai. It was a project I worked with a couple of my friends, who helped me with art and music.

      <p>
        We entered it into the Scholastic Arts and Writing Awards 2016. It was a great experience making it, learning a lot of time and project management skills.

      <h1>Game Dev (p.2)</h1>
      <p>
        A year ago, I took a more artsy role, doing the art and music for my friend Peter (Pecas) for his game <a href="https://pecas.itch.io/boomeraxe">Boomeraxe</a>, a speedrunning platformer. As of September 2018, it received 700~ views and 100+ downloads.

      <p>
        We went to TOJam '18 making <a href="https://pecas.itch.io/duelmania">DuelMania </a>, a small turn-based rpg with rhythm game mechanics.

			<h1>Projects: Programming</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/bill-l1/notescribe" target="_blank">Notescribe (WIP)</a><h2>
      <p>Started at Hack The North 2019, Notescribe, is a web service that helps students easily transcribe and annotate audio from lectures.</p>
      <p>Aided by Google's Speech-to-text API, students and staff only need to make minor changes to make readable notes from a recording. Notescribe is built in Flask (Python) and Google Firebase for the back-end, and utilizes Bootstrap for the front-end.</p>

			<h1>Programming (p.2)</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://github.com/Aarish-A/Hawkshot" target="_blank">Hawkshot</a></h2>
			<p>This was our group of 3's submission for the <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/DevRel/legends-of-runeterra-developer-challenge-announcement" target="_blank">Riot Games Legends of Runeterra API Challenge.</a></p>
      <p>Hawkshot is a social web service that allows players of the game Legends of Runeterra to create and vote on hints on how to play the game and improve.</p>
      <p>Users can create an account through Google Firebase to access the website's voting and creation features. I built the back-end API in Flask using Google Firebase for authentication and storing user and hint data. The front-end was built in React, and the in-game component was built in Electron.</p>

			<h1>Hackathons + Contests</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://devpost.com/software/f-speaking" target="_blank">F Speaking: the F stands for Fix</a></h2>
      <p>
        My group's submission for Hack the 6ix 2018 was a web application that could help people practice their public speaking. Using Google's Speech to Text API, we compared someone's speech with their original text and suggest things they could improve on. We built the application with Node.js, using p5.js and CSS to draw objects on screen.
      </p>
			<h2><a href="https://devpost.com/software/data_dump" target="_blank">Insurance Informatics</a></h2>
			<p>
        At Hack The North 2018, my group made a program that could read insurance data and dynamically display demographic data using dc.js. These graphs can be interacted with and filtered to a user's selection.

      <h2><a href="https://devpost.com/software/beat-the-leak" target="_blank">Beat The Leak</a></h2>
      <p>
        Our group made this project at MasseyHacks 2017. With Processing, we built a simple kid's game to teach keyboard fundamentals and the importance of water conservation.
      </p>
			<h2><a href="https://luminara--adeelerino.repl.co/" target="_blank">Luminara</a></h2>
			<p>
        I built this small simulation game for a p5.js challenge hosted by Hack Club and Repl.it. Based off Electroplankton for the DS, shapes play notes and create music as they move down paths set by the user. It got 5th place in total number of votes.

      <h1>Projects: Music</h1>
      <p>
        I got my start playing violin for 8 years starting at 6 years old, completing RCM Grades 5 and 7. I had some exposure to stage performance at recitals, in front of the parents of the music school I went to. I never finished music theory, but I'm willing to return and complete it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I only started to seriously pick up singing when I was 15. Before that, singing was mainly a small hobby. This was around the time I started to rap and songwrite too. I spent a lot of my off time during bus rides and vacations thinking of lyrics and melodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was a vocalist in my high school's rock band, Forest Fire. Check out one of my performances here.

      <h1>Music (p.2)</h1>
      <p>
        I started picking up production in 2017 in FL Studio making trap beats, using online samples and mixing/mastering tutorials on YouTube. I've recently branched out into some pop and lofi on the side. In the future, I want to be able to work with EDM.
      </p>

       Here is a recent track of mine. You can find more on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3ZqXeLe8VdoWqrZONS6GP9">my Spotify profile</a>.

      <h1>Goals + Aspirations</h1>
      <p>
        I want to gain enough experience to be able to work independently. Although I do well with work that is assigned to me, having the freedom to choose what I can do projectwise is much more enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p>
        My long term goal is being able to make a name for myself. I want to impact as many people's lives as possible doing the things I love doing best, whether it's through coding or music. One of my biggest motivators is seeing that I've made a positive contribution, and being able to make a living through that experience is something I dream about doing.
